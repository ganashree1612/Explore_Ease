An easy-to-do trek giving magnificent views of 3 hills in the neighbourhood namely Channagiri, Skandagiri, and Nandi hills. A narrow trail with thorny bushes leads you to Horagina Betta. Avoid going immediately after the monsoon as bushes grow up very fast and chances of missing trails are more. There is a stretch that is steep and challenging. The tall trees, misty hills, steep incline, views of neighbouring hills makes Horagina Betta an exciting trek.  It takes about 4 hours to complete the trek."
